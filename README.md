## Description
SaySpell is a basic addon that posts a /party message every time you cast specific spells.

Instead of having to do macros for every spell and spamming the chat with "Used Shield Wall !", you can use this addon instead and it will do a much better job, with zero spam, the message will only be sent AFTER you cast the spell.

There are no commands, or interface options, you must add your spells manually on the .lua file.

Addon created for Wrath of the Lich King (3.3.5a), tested on Warmane-Blackrock.
